makes code less brital
helps keep code DRY
helps deal with issues of complexity/maintanability

Creating objects allow programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
